#### Create a Sales database (you can use Microsoft Access as the database format). Create three tables inside the database:
1. The Buyers Table. Columns: ID, first name, last name;
2. Table Sellers. Columns: ID, first name, last name;
3. Sales Table. Columns: transaction ID, customer identifier, merchant identifier, transaction amount, date of the transaction.
#### Fill the tables with data and set referential integrity rules.
#### Implement a WinForms application that allows the user to select a table name from the sample.mdb database (for example, using a drop-down list). as a result of selecting a table, the application should display the contents of this table on the form.
