#### Create a "Cowshed" database containing a single "Herd" table (fields: ID, cow Name, milk yield per month).
#### Develop a WinForms application that performs the following functions:
1. Displays information from the database when the app is launched.
2. Make changes (add, modify, add) using the DataGridView features.
3. Saving changes to the database or canceling user actions.
4. Additionally: before saving, a window should appear showing the changed rows and asking for confirmation of actions.
#### Use offline mode ADO.NET.
#### To use connected mode ADO.NET. To create a connection string, use the SqlConnectionStringBuilder object.
#### There are two ways to create commands for the adapter:
1. create command objects in code;
2. use the SqlCommandBuilder class.
